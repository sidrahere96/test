## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate into the project:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Compile a specific solution:

bash
Copy code
javac src/Problem1.java
Run it:

bash
Copy code
java -cp src Problem1
📄 Problem Descriptions
Each Java file corresponds to a single problem.
The general format is:

ProblemX.java

Contains a main method (if needed)

Includes helper methods to keep logic clean

Fully commented for clarity

Detailed explanations can be found in /docs/explanation.md.

✔️ Example Solution Format
Here’s the consistent format used in each solution file:

java
Copy code
/**
 * Problem X — Short description of the problem.
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - Outline your algorithm.
 * - Note edge cases.
 * - Mention time/space complexity.
 */

public class ProblemX {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example input or testing logic
    }

    public static int solve(...) {
        // Core solution
    }
}
